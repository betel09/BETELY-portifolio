                <h3>Danakil Depression</h3>

<p>Positioned on the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea is the Danakil Depression. It’s oicially one of driest and hottest places on Earth.
With temperatures that oen reach 50+ degrees, it’s easy to see why.  This is a surreal piece of real estate that’s strewn with active volcanoes, salted basins, hot springs, and a lava lake – all of which combine to create a very lunar-like landscape.
Sitting below sea level, it’s the lowest point in Africa and second in the world (aer the Dead Sea).
Do a bit of planning before you go as the climate can be harsh if you aren’t prepared.  But the beauty and mystery of this place make any preparation well worth it</p>

    <h3> Lalibela</h3>

                        <img class="image_wrapper" src="images/lali.jpg.PNG" alt="image" />

<p>Lalibela pretty much blows the mind of everyone who visits.  This medieval settlement was designed to be a kind of second Jerusalem and modern day inhabitants remain proud of this distinction.
Lalibela is perched in the middle of a broad church complex made entire of rock.
There are 11 churches in the settlement, monolithic and grand, all built by King Lalibela as early as the 12th century.
Remarkable because of the architectural design, the churches are actually dug into the ground.
The most famous, and most beautiful, is St George’s Cathedral.  An awe-inspiring sight.
If you’re so inclined, there are several monasteries in the nearby area that are worth visiting.</p>

 <h3> The Blue Nile Falls</h3>

<p>The Nile River is the longest in Africa and its two tributaries are the White Nile and the Blue Nile.
The Blue Nile begins in Ethiopia and along its course you’ll find the   Blue Nile Falls – a spot to rival Niagara.
About 90 minutes from Bahar Dar the scenery here is truly breath-taking. Locally known as Tis Abbay, or ‘great smoke,’ the falls are about 45 metres high during the rainy season.
Just downstream from the falls you’ll find Ethiopia’s first stone bridge, built in the 17th century.</p>

                        <p>The 18th century of Ethiopia was Gondar, where then Emperor Fasiladas built his fairy tale castles.
This UNESCO World Heritage Site is now a wonderful museum complex that showcases the last centuries of the country’s emperors.
Lying in a bowl of hills, the Camelot of Africa is a magnificent sight.
The wealth and splendor of this ancient capital can still be seen in the modern city.
Despite its size Gondar is extremely walkable – start from the Italian piazza in the city centre and enjoy a stroll through tin

roofed stone buildings.
Great shopping, restaurants, and hotels are all available here. In nearby Gorgora you’ll find a small but impressive Christian monastery.
